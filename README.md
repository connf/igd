## The Technical Test Information

A scrabble club requires a system to store and update members’ details. They would like to see
and update their members' contact details. They would also like to see the following on the
member page:

● The date the member joined
● The members average score
● Highest score (when and which game)
● Recent games

All recorded scrabble games are played between 2-4 players, the player with the highest score
at the end of the game wins.

There should be a leaderboard page which shows the top 10 average member scores in order.
